    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Erin Marie's own Fettuccine Alfredo recipe modified from her mother.
        The use of heavy cream accents the cheese, which will in turn cause you to eat the whole plate.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>24 ounces dry fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>3/4 pint heavy cream</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 dash garlic salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
